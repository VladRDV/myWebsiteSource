Creating a kiosk application can be quite a challenge, even if the final product is supposed to be simple in terms of functionality and you're only planning to run it on a small number of devices. For serious projects normally using Ubuntu Core and ssh  would be recommended, to safely maintain and update a big number of kiosk devices at once, and with release of Ubuntu Core 18 quite a few things have changed and are not well documented yet, like snapping Electron apps for instance. While making simple prototype or weekend pet project nobody wants that kind of headache.

So finding a simpler way is in order 

In this project we are going to use
* Platform: Raspberry Pi 3
* Platform OS: Raspbian
* Development OS: in my case Ubuntu 16.04
* Framework: React 16
* Hosting: Surge
* RealVNC

### Step 1: Installing Raspbian
### Step 2: Install Kiosk for Chromium
### Step 3: Creating React project
### Step 4: Setting up VNC
### Step 5: Locking your Kiosk app from it\'s admin panel
### Step 6: Make your app start on boot
To make that happen you need to place Kiosk\'s desktop icon into /startup folder
### Step 7: Turn screen orientation
#### Step 7.1: Turn screen orientation

### Step 8: Setup application reboot schedule 
### Step 9: Hide Raspbian cursor
### Step 10: Deploy your app
